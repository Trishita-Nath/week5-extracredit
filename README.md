I am introducing the elasticsearch module. Running command "pip install elasticsearch" installs the module package for python code. 

We can run elasticsearch as a service on local machine. 
Steps to run on Windows -

After installing it, we can index json data to the elastic search and then query it to perform searches. The code I have attached includes a sample example on how to index document data to elasticsearch and then query it to fetch the results.
